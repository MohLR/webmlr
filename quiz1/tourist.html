                <p>The Simpang Lima Gumul Monument (Indonesian: Monumen Simpang Lima Gumul) or commonly abbreviated as SLG is a monument at Kediri, East Java in Indonesia. The monument resembles the Arc de Triomphe of Paris, France. Construction of SLG began in 2003 and was inaugurated in 2008. The building is located at Tugurejo Village, Ngasem district of Kediri Regency, precisely at the center of the meeting of five roads (Lima means five) that lead to Gampengrejo, Pagu, Pare, Pesantren and Plosoklaten.</p>
                <p>The specicific reason for building Gumul Kediri Simpang Lima Monument is unknown. In some sources, it was inspired by Jongko Jojoboyo, the king of the 12th century Kediri Kingdom who wanted to unite five regions in Kediri Regency. Aside from being an icon, SLG is currently also a center of the new economy and trade of Kediri Regency.</p>
